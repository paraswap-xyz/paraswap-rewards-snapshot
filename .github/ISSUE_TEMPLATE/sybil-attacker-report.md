# Reported Addresses

<!--
Provide a list of related addresses that are eligible for the ParaSwap Fairdrop.

The list must contain at least 10 eligible addresses at the time of review or it will not be considered. The eligible address list can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hop-protocol/hop-airdrop/master/src/data/eligibleAddresses.txt. Reports will be evaluated on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Example:
```
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000004
```
-->

# Reasoning

<!--
Describe how the addresses are related with as much detail as possible.

Example:

All addresses called `swapAndSend` on Polygon between 1:30pm UTC and 2:30pm UTC on January 9th and then called `swapAndSend` on Arbitrum between 13:00pm UTC and 14:00pm UTC on January 13th in the exact same sequence. All addresses also interact with Zapper on Polygon and hold a “Governance Toucan" on Arbitrum.
-->

# Methodology

<!--
Explain the method used to discover the addresses and provide proof that they are all related and likely operated by a single individual/entity with a high degree of probability. Self-reports can simply include a signature of "HOP_SYBIL_REPORT" by each reported address. The methodology should be easy to verify or the report will not be considered. Please, also include links to any additional materials you’d like to provide like a github repo containing the script used to uncover the reported addresses.

Example:

The reported addresses were discovered by building a dataset of addresses that interacted with hop and when they made certain transactions and then using an algorithm to identify repeating patterns in the order of those interactions.
